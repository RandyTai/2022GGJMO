## Game Introduction
隨著網絡的發展，人與人的溝通拉的越來越頻繁，促使了許多 "友善" 的交流，而網絡對話以法律難以控制。 很多人看到與自己觀點不符合後的事物就即刻進行反擊，造成兩方勢力就此開戰，水火不容，你死我亡。 根據此理念，本遊戲以 2D 平面戰鬥為底層機制，描述兩個人（對立面）為彼此不同的觀點進行罵戰。以虛擬人類罵戰的過程，在聊天框裏進行毫無意義的戰鬥。 With the development of the Internet, communication between people has become more and more frequent, which has prompted many "friendly" exchanges, and the Internet dialogue is difficult to control by law. Many people immediately counterattack when they see things that are inconsistent with their own views, causing the two forces to go to war on this. According to this concept, the game uses 2D plane combat as the underlying mechanism and describes two people (opposites) fighting against each other with different viewpoints. In the process of virtual human scolding, fighting meaningless battles in the chatbox.
